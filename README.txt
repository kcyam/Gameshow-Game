README: Gameshow Game

This is a class project. There is no exit button, so Alt-F4 (sorry). There might be trouble starting a new game after the first game, but it should work if everyone exits out. Also, when one game finishes, we forgot to make the cursor visible again. We also don't have the code anymore.
